## Description
We need to ensure the UI compatibility with the next version of OpenSearch vX.X.
This update is still being discussed, but we need to be aware of potential issues.

For that, we need to:

- [ ] Review opensearch and opensearch-dashboard latest stable changelog. 
- [ ] Identify improvements and potential impact on the UI.
- [ ] Create new tracking and development branches.
- [ ] Develop a testing environment to verify our components would work under this new build.

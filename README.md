## Welcome

Wazuh dashboard is a fork of the [OpenSearch Dashboards][opensearch-dashboards] which
incorporate changes to make it easier to use for Wazuh users. Our aim is to contribute
back any work not tied specifically to Wazuh.

Wazuh is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open-source project. Wazuh
helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring
hosts at an operating system and application level.

You can learn more about it at [wazuh.com][wazuh-web].
